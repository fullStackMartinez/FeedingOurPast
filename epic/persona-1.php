			<h3>User Case</h3>
			<h4>Lending a Helping Hand</h4>
			<p>Actor: Andrew Candelaria</p>
			<p>Role: Find a place that is close and open to food donations that has open business hours on the weekend.</p>
			<p>Andrew and his roommates have decided to vacate the bachelor pad they have been living in for the past 2 years and
				go their separate ways. Although Andrew is busy with his new job, he has found a nice apartment to live in. With the recent decision
				to move out of the house, Andrew and his 2 friends are deep cleaning their rented in order to get their deposit back. They've realized
				that after 2 years together, they have accumulated a lot of unused canned and non perishable goods. Andrew wants to box them up and donate them.
				With his new job and big move, Andrew wants to go somewhere close, open during his free time, and only wants to make one easy trip.
				He doesn't have much time to call and look for places, so he needs a quick resource that will show him open food banks that are
				near him that take food donations. </p>
			<p>Usage Preconditions: Andrew has a box of perishable items that he needs to donate, and access to the internet.</p>
			<p>Usage Postconditions: Andre donates his box of perishable items to a donation center 3 streets away.
