			<p>Age: 24 years old</p>
			<p>Lives in the Nob Hill area of Albuquerque, New Mexico</p>
			<p>Profession: Recent college grad who just got a job as a financial advisor for a bank in Downtown Albuquerque.</p>
			<p>Technology: Andrew owns a laptop (PC) and a mobile smart phone (Iphone 6). He also owns a tablet that is a few years old that he rarely uses.
				He is proficient in using all three, knows how to download an app and use it, load a web page and browse the internet. He uses Chrome as his browser and texts as his main form of communication. Whenever he has a question for something he needs/wants to know, he uses Google.
			</p>
			<p>Attitude and Behaviors: Andrew is a recent UNM graduate, having worked hard for 5 years studying full time, while working a part time job that took most of his weekends/free time. The past 2 years he has been living with 2 friends, both of which are similar in age and already in the work force.
				Andrew's new life is busy, he is a hard worker, with a new job he is learning the ropes, taking any free time to study his employee handbook and also moving into a new apartment.
			</p>
			<p>Needs: Andrew has a lot of things to do on his plate, including cleaning out the rental property he and his friends are about to vacate. He needs to find a place close to him to donate all the extra perishables he doesn't intend on using, that accepts food donations and is open when he has free time.

			<h3>User Case</h3>
			<h4>Lending a Helping Hand</h4>
			<p>Actor: Andrew Candelaria</p>
			<p>Role: Find a place that is close and open to food donations that has open business hours on the weekend.</p>
			<p>Andrew and his roommates have decided to vacate the bachelor pad they have been living in for the past 2 years and
				go their separate ways. Although Andrew is busy with his new job, he has found a nice apartment to live in. With the recent decision
				to move out of the house, Andrew and his 2 friends are deep cleaning their rented in order to get their deposit back. They've realized
				that after 2 years together, they have accumulated a lot of unused canned and non perishable goods. Andrew wants to box them up and donate them.
				With his new job and big move, Andrew wants to go somewhere close, open during his free time, and only wants to make one easy trip.
				He doesn't have much time to call and look for places, so he needs a quick resource that will show him open food banks that are
				near him that take food donations. </p>
			<p>Usage Preconditions: Andrew has a box of perishable items that he needs to donate, and access to the internet.</p>
			<p>Usage Postconditions: Andre donates his box of perishable items to a donation center 3 streets away.
