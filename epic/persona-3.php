		<h1>Feeding Our Past: Persona 3</h1>

		<p>Define a Persona representing the Community Engagement Partner for the capstone project:
			This persona will be an Community Engagement Partner (read organization) seeking donations and volunteers.</p>

		<p>I am Tammy Tomlinson. I am the executive director at a local food bank in Albuquerque NM. The food bank is an established and successful providing food boxes, available for pickup at our warehouse or delivery, to needy families in the Albuquerque metro area.</p>

		<p>Additionally, We offer needy families assistance with applying for city, state, and federally sponsored services. We accept both perishable and non-perishable food items. Additionally, cash and in-kind donations are accepted. We have great working relationships with our local coorporate parners who provide substantial food and cash donations. Since we are a not for profit organization we rely on volunteers to complete a majority of the work at our facility.
		</p>

		<p>We have a great team, our technology needs are met, and our operation is very successful. Actually our success is a bit of a golden problem. We need additional volunteers to help process and distribute food boxes at the warehouse. Additionally, we could serve a larger portion of the needy in Albuquerque if we had a team of volunteer drivers to transport seniors to and from the warehouse as well as deliver food boxes to seniors (angels) home.
		</p>

		<p>We have devloped a comprehensive plan to recruit volunteers. Our greatest challenge is that we can not make changes to our web site. We need an app or additional website that we can use to coordinate, direct, and manage volunteer activities. Ideally, we would be able to log into the app/site, review our volunteers and cdm their activites.</p>

		<h2>user story</h2>
As a user I need to be able to direct volunteers to the application/website to register to volunteer at our orginazation which will be especially useful to include in our marketing materials. Additionally, I would like to get new volunteer's contact information from the application/website so I can contact and follow up with the new volunteers in a timly manner.

		<h2>use case
		</h2>

		<h2>process flow</h2>
		  <ul>
			  <li>Tammy requests page
		  	  <li>page returned to Tammy
		     <li>Tammy logs in
		     <li>Tammy is authenticated
		     <li>Tammy is given a list of volunteers who want to work

        </ul>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>The purpose of our website is to function as a stand alone site to be used by potential angels to find food security services, volunteers to donate cash, food or time, and food bank executives to find and respond to request from angels and volunteers.</p>
