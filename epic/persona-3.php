		<h1>Feeding Our Past: Persona 3</h1>

		Define a Persona representing the Community Engagement Partner for the capstone project:
This persona will be an Community Engagement Partner (read organization) seeking donations and volunteers.

I am Tammy Tomlinson. I am the executive director at a local food bank in Albuquerque NM. The food bank is an established and successful providing food boxes, available for pickup at our warehouse or delivery, to needy families in the Albuquerque metro area. Additionally, We offer needy families assistance with applying for city, state, and federally sponsored services. We accept both perishable and non-perishable food items. Additionally, cash and in-kind donations are accepted. We have great working relationships with our local coorporate parners who provide substantial food and cash donations. Since we are a not for profit organization we rely on volunteers to complete a majority of the work at our facility. We have three full time staff members beside myself. Our first full time employee Joe runs the warehouse is responsible for unloading donations, keeping the warehouse clean and organized, and loading delivery trucks for distribution of food boxes. Sally, also full time, keeps our office organized and supports our community outreach efforts. Martha our marketing and programs champion. She is deeply involved in the community and our outreach hero. Joe, Sally, Martha, and I have work computers and smart phones provided by the food bank. Joe uses his desktop in the warehouse for internet, calender, and e-mail functions on his computer on a daily basis and annually provides budget planning feedback. Joe is a heavy user of his smart phone coordinating a majority of his activities using voice and text. He often uses the smart phone to provide maps and directions to our drivers and volunteers. Sally also has a desktop which she uses for internet, calender, and e-mail. Additionally she uses the desktop Microsoft office suite to support our operations and marketing efforts. Sally has a smart phone, mainly for texting and voice communications. Martha is always on the go and is a heavy laptop and smart phone user. My laptop and smart phone use is very similar to Marthas. We contract our website and e-mail services with our parent/umbrella organization via our Washington DC offices.

We have a great team, our technology needs are met, and our operation is very successful. Actually our success is a bit of a golden problem. We need additional volunteers to help process and distribute food boxes at the warehouse. Additionally, we could serve a larger portion of the needy in Albuquerque if we had a team of volunteer drivers to transport seniors to and from the warehouse as well as deliver food boxes to seniors (angels) home. We have devloped a comprehensive plan to recruit volunteers. Our greatest challenge is that we can not make changes to our web site. We need an app or additional website that we can use to coordinate, direct, and manage volunteer activities. Ideally, we would be able to log into the app/site, review our volunteers and cdm their activites. 

		user story
As a user I need to be able to direct volunteers to the application/website to register to volunteer at our orginazation which will be especially useful to include in our marketing materials. Additionally, I would like to get new volunteer's contact information from the application/website so I can contact and follow up with the new volunteers in a timly manner.
