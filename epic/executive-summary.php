		<h1>Feeding Our Past: Executive Summary</h1>
		<p>The purpose of our capstone project is to help Stop ABQ Senior Hunger by providing an easy to use website, and will be built with 3 types of users in mind: seniors with food insecurity, community volunteers, and committed organizations. The website will have two key features. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first is a simple interface that takes a senior’s or volunteer’s location and shows them the nearest senior-serving community organization, via Google maps, where they can either receive food assistance or donate/volunteer.<br><br></li>
				<li>The second feature will allow committed volunteers and senior-serving community organizations to have profiles and log in to facilitate contact with each other. The organizations will also be able to share bulletins/announcements, via a form, to the website.<br><br></li>
				<li>The additional "like" feature will allow a volunteer to "like" posts (written by organizations) to indicate their interest in events/announcements.</li>
			</ul>

<!--		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>The purpose of our website is to provide an easy to use resource to help stop ABQ senior hunger, and will be built with 3 types of users in mind: seniors with food insecurity, community volunteers, and committed organizations. The website will allow volunteers and organizations to connect and help seniors seeking food assistance.</p>

		<h2>Audience</h2>
		<p>This site is designed to be simple to use and targeted to seniors, volunteers, and food assistance organizations in the Albuquerque community.</p>

		<h2>Goal</h2>
		<p>The Goal of the "Feeding Our Past" CapStone project is to provide Albuquerque NM seniors food resources. The Road Runner Food Bank of New Mexico succinctly outlines the need for "Feeding Our Past" stating, "Seniors have said to us one of the first expenses they cut from their monthly expenses is food...seniors, limiting their food intake can drastically alter their health and significantly impact their quality of life." It seems likely, that seniors choosing to cut their food intake to make ends meet do not have access to internet services.  Family, friends, and neighbors of these at risk seniors need an easy informational website/application listing resources to meet the unique needs of Albuquerque's seniors. In most cases Albuquerque's food banks/pantries offer additional services such as assistance with trash collection and water bills. In addition to the seniors in need, the goal will be to connect community volunteers with food assistance organizations who help seniors. </p>
