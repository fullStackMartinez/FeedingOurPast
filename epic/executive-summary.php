		<h1>Feeding Our Past: Executive Summary</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>This website serves two functions: first, it provides quick location information to elderly people looking for food aide, and volunteers searching for nearby food banks for donation drop off.
			It also serves as a community outreach hub for committed volunteers and organizations that can connect in order to help hungry seniors in Albuquerque.</p>
		<p>The purpose of our website is to provide an easy to use resource
			that will link Albuquerque's food resources with motivated individuals who
			want to help ensure that our seniors can recieve the resources they need.</p>
		<p>This project will be a website which can be used by 3 types of users (help seekers, volunteers, organizations) to interact with ABQ City Data and the Stop Senior Hunger Initiative, built with full stack  development.</p>
		<p>The purpose of our website is to function as a stand alone site to be used by potential angels to find food security services, volunteers to donate cash, food or time, and food bank executives to find and respond to request from angels and volunteers.</p>

		<h2>Audience</h2>

		<h2>Goal</h2>
		<p>The Goal of the "Feeding Our Past" CapStone project is to provide Albuquerque NM seniors food resources. The Road Runner Food Bank of New Mexico succinctly outlines the need for "Feeding Our Past" stating, "Seniors have said to us one of the first expenses they cut from their monthly expenses is food...seniors, limiting their food intake can drastically alter their health and significantly impact their quality of life." It seems likely, that seniors choosing to cut their food intake to make ends meet do not have access to internet services.  Family, friends, and neighbors of these at risk seniors need an easy informational website/application listing resources to meet the unique needs of Albuquerque's seniors. In most cases Albuquerque's food banks/pantries offer additional services such as assistance with trash collection and water bills.<p>
