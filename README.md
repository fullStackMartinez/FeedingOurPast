# FeedingOurPast
This is a repository for our capstone project. We are using PHP and MySQL to build a small database for a site that connects food donation centers with volunteers in ABQ to help feed hungry senior citizens. 

We used OOP to develop Classes and API's in order to access and update our databases. We also wrote tests and tested our Classes using PHPUnit
